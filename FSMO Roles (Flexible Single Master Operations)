FSMO Roles (Flexible Single Master Operations)
Definition

FSMO roles are special roles assigned to Domain Controllers in an Active Directory environment.
These roles ensure that critical tasks are handled by only one Domain Controller at a time to avoid conflicts.

Types of FSMO Roles

There are 5 FSMO Roles:

2 Forest-level roles

3 Domain-level roles

Forest-Level FSMO Roles
1. Schema Master

Controls changes to the Active Directory schema

Only one Schema Master per forest

Required when installing or modifying applications like Exchange

2. Domain Naming Master

Controls adding or removing domains in the forest

Only one Domain Naming Master per forest

Required when creating or deleting domains

Domain-Level FSMO Roles
3. RID Master

Allocates Relative ID (RID) pools to Domain Controllers

Required to create new user, group, or computer objects

One RID Master per domain

4. PDC Emulator

Acts as the primary domain controller

Handles:

Password changes

Account lockouts

Time synchronization

One PDC Emulator per domain

5. Infrastructure Master

Updates references between domains

Ensures correct group membership

One Infrastructure Master per domain

FSMO Role Summary Table
FSMO Role	Scope	Function
Schema Master	Forest	Schema changes
Domain Naming Master	Forest	Domain add/remove
RID Master	Domain	Object creation
PDC Emulator	Domain	Password & time
Infrastructure Master	Domain	Cross-domain updates
How to Check FSMO Roles
Using Command Prompt

Run on Domain Controller:

netdom query fsmo

Transfer FSMO Roles (GUI Method)
Transfer Schema Master

Register schema snap-in:

regsvr32 schmmgmt.dll


Open MMC

Add Active Directory Schema

Right-click → Change Active Directory Domain Controller

Transfer Domain Naming Master

Open Active Directory Domains and Trusts

Right-click → Operations Master

Transfer role

Transfer RID, PDC, Infrastructure

Open Active Directory Users and Computers

Right-click domain

Select Operations Masters

Transfer roles

FSMO Role Placement Best Practice

Single Domain Controller:

All FSMO roles on one DC

Multiple Domain Controllers:

PDC Emulator and RID Master on same DC

Schema Master and Domain Naming Master together

Conclusion

FSMO roles ensure proper functioning and consistency of Active Directory.
Each role performs a unique and critical task and must be available at all times.
